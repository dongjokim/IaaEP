ANALYSIS of the dN/dEta  in PbPb and pp 
the main result: the narrowing of dN/dEta in heavy ion collisions
----------------------------------------------------------
main analysis macro
z01.IAA_Deta.C
z02.CalIAADeta.C
z03.ComparionsDeta.C // for general comparison after substraction of the backgrouds

INPUT to the analysis:  jcorran.root file from HI and pp

at the moment the reading is "automatized" by switches 
The macro than creates an output file with apropriate output name
----------------------------------------------------------
Analysis:

z01.IAA_Deta.C

the near side delta eta distributions are corrected on mixed event
in z and centrality bins. 
(above trigger sumTriggBinsForMixAbove    = 6.0; and assoc  sumAssocBinsForMixAbove    = 4.0;
the mixed event histograms are added together. Assumption is that for high pT straight tracks
triangle does not change much
).

the near side Delta eta is corrected for residual wing correction ??
 1/Ntrigg * dN/deta are written to output


z02.CalIAADeta.C
the bg is estimated with a fit  (peak = kaplan ,  bg =constant)
bg  subtracted 1/Ntrigg * dN/deta are written to output

SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES
DrawSys_v3_AliceTempl.C  

inputs are outputs from eta_v2_ppzbin.C    
for vairous setting and the macro combines differences from reference analysis to syst error 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DrawFinal3.C   draws the final plots in alice template


to abbrevaitations  
GGC == fit bg with gaus+gaus+const
KC == fit kaplan + constant
