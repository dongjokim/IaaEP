ANALYSIS of the dN/dEta  in PbPb and pp 
the main result: the narrowing of dN/dEta in heavy ion collisions


----------------------------------------------------------
main analysis macro ...... eta_v2_ppzbin.C  (centrality from VZERO) or eta_v2_ppzbin_TPC.C  (centrality from TPC)

INPUT to the analysis:  jcorran.root file from HI and pp

at the moment the reading is "automatized" by switches 
1) one can choose from  2 set of track cuts
CUT1 = TPC only cuts
CUT3 = RAA cuts

2) Increased Contamination  by fake primary track 0 and +- 30%

3) For pp we allow as input with and without SDD

The macro than creates an output file with apropriate output name
----------------------------------------------------------
Analysis:
the near side and away side delta eta distributions are corrected on mixed event
in z and centrality bins. 
(above trigger sumTriggBinsForMixAbove    = 6.0; and assoc  sumAssocBinsForMixAbove    = 4.0;
the mixed event histograms are added together. Assumption is that for high pT straight tracks
triangle does not change much
).

the near side Delta eta is corrected for residual wing correction

the bg is estimated with a fit  (peak = kaplan ,  bg =constant)

bg  subtracted 1/Ntrigg * dN/deta are written to output

inputs are outputs from eta_v2_ppzbin.C    
for vairous setting and the macro combines differences from reference analysis to syst error
